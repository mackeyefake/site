a form of life which is alone in the universe is significant only to itself; there is no one else to acknowledge their significance, but yet the universe looks into itself only through them. the probability of humanity being alone is unbelievably low, and for us to waste this to allow shareholders to watch a line go up is so mindnumbingly pointless that the lack of purpose involved in that outcome alone should motivate one to seek a different future.

humanity is not necessarily alone, but it is likely that we will go millienia without contact with other sapient species. considering how our advancement accelerates exponentially, we may be unrecognizable by that time, as the technological advancements required to find alien life are unimaginable as of now. effectively, then, we are alone, and we are young, but on the timescale of the universe, we will be unimaginably ancient in comparison to life which forms elsewhere. we may live out our entire existence believing we are alone due to an inability to surpass universal expansion before it whisks away any potential for contact with another, and blankets the stars in our skies with an insurmountable black.

there is no one to let down if our existence is not taken advantage of. but to be given this opportunity and fail at spread our wings would be a disappointing way to allow the universe's eyes to close for a final time. nearly every human ever born after the dawn of civilization has lived and died a slave or serf; to let humanity suffer and sweat and cry and bleed to the benefit of those without mercy for any longer is a moral failing and a betrayal.

indifference is not inherent to us, it is taught; pacisfism and centrism are the greatest enemy to true change. to simply accept that your goods will be produced for free by children you will never meet in a country you cannot find on a map is the most egregious entitlement imaginable, and it exists in almost everyone. the basic lack of empathy which plagues us is directly a response to capital modes of production, a defense mechanism to prevent one from thinking too hard about the unethical nature from which they derive their luxury.

it isnt enough only to place faith in the future of humanity; we must be a part of it.
